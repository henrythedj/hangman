Wild West Hangman
Hangman project for 'The Odin Project'

The 5desk.txt file is just a dictionary. The game will automatically pull only words with a length between 5 and 12. One can alter the
5desk file, but it must be named 5desk and words must be separated 
with 
a 
return (enter key).

One can save your game and the game will make a save file directory inside the directory the hangman.rb file is saved in.
Do not rename the saved game directory.

The cowboy prodding you for letters can be rude, but don't take him too seriously.
